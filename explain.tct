This code defines a Django view function called time_cycles that processes time intervals and divides them into "day" and "night" periods. It assumes that:

    Night is from 9:00 PM (21:00) to 6:00 AM.
    Day is from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM (21:00).

Detailed Explanation

    Decorator Usage:

    python

@auth
@csrf_exempt

    @auth: This decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access the endpoint.
    @csrf_exempt: This decorator bypasses CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, making it possible to handle POST requests without the need for a CSRF token.

Function Definition:

python

def time_cycles(request):

    request: The HTTP request object. The function expects a POST request containing a JSON body with start_date and end_date.

Parsing and Validation:

python

data = json.loads(request.body)
start_date = datetime.fromisoformat(data.get('start_date'))
end_date = datetime.fromisoformat(data.get('end_date'))

    The function extracts start_date and end_date from the JSON body and converts them to datetime objects.

python

if start_date >= end_date:
    return JsonResponse({'error': 'Please enter a valid start and end date'})

    A validation step checks if the start_date is earlier than the end_date. If not, an error response is returned.

Initialization:

python

night_time = []
day_time = []
current_date = start_date

    night_time and day_time are lists to store the respective time periods.
    current_date is initialized to start_date for further processing.

First Lap (Partial Period Calculation):

    The first if-else block determines whether the initial current_date falls within the night or day period.

If Night:

python

if is_night_time(current_date):  # If it's night
    night_end = current_date.replace(hour=6, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    if night_end <= current_date:
        night_end += timedelta(days=1)
    if night_end > end_date:
        night_end = end_date
    night_time.append({
        "start_date": current_date.isoformat(),
        "end_date": night_end.isoformat()
    })
    current_date = night_end

    night_end: The end of the night period is set to 6:00 AM of the current date.
    If night_end is earlier than current_date (i.e., past midnight), it is moved to the next day.
    If night_end exceeds end_date, it is adjusted to end_date.
    A partial night period is added to night_time.
    current_date is updated to night_end.

If Day:

python

else:  # If it's day
    day_end = current_date.replace(hour=21, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    if day_end <= current_date:
        day_end += timedelta(days=1)
    if day_end > end_date:
        day_end = end_date
    day_time.append({
        "start_date": current_date.isoformat(),
        "end_date": day_end.isoformat()
    })
    current_date = day_end

    day_end: The end of the day period is set to 9:00 PM (21:00) of the current date.
    Adjustments are made if day_end is earlier than current_date.
    A partial day period is added to day_time.
    current_date is updated to day_end.

Main Loop (Full Cycles Calculation):

python

while current_date < end_date:

    This loop processes the remaining full cycles of day and night periods until current_date reaches end_date.

Day Period:

python

if 6 <= current_date.hour < 21:
    day_end = current_date.replace(hour=21, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    if day_end > end_date:
        day_end = end_date
    day_time.append({
        "start_date": current_date.isoformat(),
        "end_date": day_end.isoformat()
    })
    current_date = day_end

    If current_date falls within a day period, the end of the day is set to 9:00 PM.
    If day_end exceeds end_date, it is adjusted.
    The period is added to day_time and current_date is updated.

Night Period:

python

else:
    night_end = current_date.replace(hour=6, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + timedelta(days=1)
    if night_end > end_date:
        night_end = end_date
    night_time.append({
        "start_date": current_date.isoformat(),
        "end_date": night_end.isoformat()
    })
    current_date = night_end

    If current_date is in the night period, night_end is set to the next 6:00 AM.
    Adjustments are made if night_end exceeds end_date.
    The period is added to night_time and current_date is updated.

Final Lap (Remaining Time):

python

if current_date < end_date:
    if is_night_time(current_date):
        night_time.append({
            "start_date": current_date.isoformat(),
            "end_date": end_date.isoformat()
        })
    else:
        day_time.append({
            "start_date": current_date.isoformat(),
            "end_date": end_date.isoformat()
        })

    If there is any remaining time after the main loop, it is classified as either day or night.

Response:

python

    return JsonResponse({
        "night_time": night_time,
        "day_time": day_time
    })

        A JSON response is returned with the night_time and day_time periods.

Example

Input:

json

{
  "start_date": "2024-10-23T02:00:00",
  "end_date": "2024-10-24T11:00:00"
}

Output:

json

{
  "night_time": [
    {
      "start_date": "2024-10-23T02:00:00",
      "end_date": "2024-10-23T06:00:00"
    },
    {
      "start_date": "2024-10-23T21:00:00",
      "end_date": "2024-10-24T06:00:00"
    }
  ],
  "day_time": [
    {
      "start_date": "2024-10-23T06:00:00",
      "end_date": "2024-10-23T21:00:00"
    },
    {
      "start_date": "2024-10-24T06:00:00",
      "end_date": "2024-10-24T11:00:00"
    }
  ]
}

In this example:

    The night starts on 2024-10-23 from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM.
    The day goes from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM.
    Another night goes from 9:00 PM to the next day's 6:00 AM.
    The day starts again from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM on 2024-10-24.
